Python fundamentals to AI automations

This repository showcases my structured journey to strengthen Python skills and build practical AI projects. Over four weeks, I completed a series of mini-projects and automations using Python, Zapier, OpenAI, and LangChain.

**It demonstrates:**
- Solid understanding of Python fundamentals through hands-on coding.
- Building AI-powered automations and integrations.
- Practical experience with AI frameworks and tools like LangChain and OpenAI APIs.
- Version control and project documentation using GitHub.

This repo reflects my commitment to learning, problem-solving, and producing tangible results, skills I bring to any software development or AI-focused role.
